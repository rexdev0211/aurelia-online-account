            Multi-factor authentication (MFA) combines two or more independent credentials; what you know (password); what you have (security
            token). The goal is to create a layered defence and make it more difficult
            for an unauthorised person to access your account. If one factor is compromised the attacker still has at least
            one more barrier to breach before successfully accessing your account.

          <h6 class="mb-4">
            Relying on just usernames and passwords to secure your online account is no longer considered safe. Data breaches occur daily
            and hackers are inventing new ways to take over your accounts. Protect yourself by enabling MFA. This blocks
            anyone using your stolen data by verifying your identity through your device.
